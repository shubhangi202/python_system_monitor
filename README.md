## Features

- 🚀 Real-time system metrics monitoring
- 💻 Per-core CPU usage and temperature tracking
- 🧮 Memory and swap usage visualization
- 🌐 Network bandwidth monitoring with rate smoothing
- 📊 Process management with detailed statistics
- ⚡ Asynchronous architecture for optimal performance
- 🎯 Interactive process control (kill, sort)
- 📱 Responsive terminal UI with automatic resizing

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- Linux/Unix-based system

Required packages:
- psutil>=5.9.0
- aiofiles>=24.1.0

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhangi202/python_system_monitor.git
cd python_system_monitor
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the monitor:

```bash
python3 run_monitor.py
```

### Controls

- `↑`/`↓`: Navigate process list
- `k`: Kill selected process
- `q`: Quit
- `r`: Refresh display
- `F5`: Force refresh

## Stress Testing

The project includes a stress test script to verify monitoring capabilities:
```bash
chmod +x stress_test.sh
./stress_test.sh
```

## Architecture

- **Async Core**: Built on Python's asyncio for non-blocking operations
- **Modular Design**: Separate monitors for different system aspects
- **Optimized Updates**: Variable refresh rates per component
- **Resource Efficient**: Minimal CPU/Memory footprint
